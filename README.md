# mlsys

ML System for training models in Jupyter and deploying to GCP with scheduled predictions.

## Overview

Repository for machine learning development and production deployment with progressive deployment strategy across dev, staging, and prod environments.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Launch Jupyter for notebook development
uv run jupyter lab
```

## Notebook Development

Notebooks in `notebooks/` are used for exploratory data analysis and model development:

### Workflow
1. **Download Data**: Use `bq_get()` to fetch data from BigQuery
2. **Explore**: Perform EDA, visualizations, feature engineering
3. **Train Models**: Experiment with algorithms and hyperparameters
4. **Evaluate**: Assess model performance
5. **Upload Model**: Use `gcs_put()` to save model artifacts to GCS

### Example
```python
from mlsys.bq import bq_get
from mlsys.gcs import gcs_put
from mlsys.settings import GCS_BUCKET_MODELS_DEV

# Download data
df = bq_get("SELECT * FROM project.dataset.training_data")

# Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Upload to GCS
gcs_put(model, GCS_BUCKET_MODELS_DEV, "my-model/v1/model.pkl")
```
